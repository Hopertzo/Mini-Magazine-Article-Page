            <p>Web design has changed drastically over the past two decades. From static HTML pages to interactive and responsive layouts, the web has evolved into a dynamic platform that connects people, businesses, and cultures across the globe.</p>
            <p>Modern web design is no longer just about “making things look pretty.” It focuses on usability, accessibility, and performance. Designers must consider how websites function across different devices, from large desktop screens to small smartphones.</p>
            <p>Frameworks like <span>Bootstrap</span> and <span>Tailwind CSS</span> simplified styling, while responsive design techniques became the industry standard. Today, even beginners can create professional-looking websites in a short time, but strong fundamentals still matter.</p>
